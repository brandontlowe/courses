# print(divide(10, 2))

# The file you run is __main__
# Other files (i.e. modules) are named according to their paths used for importing

# The paths/locations from which the interpreter searches for imports can
# be found by importing sys (sys.path).

# The first path in the list will be the directory containing __main__.
# The second is the Python path. For Unix systems you can define this in
# a Bash shell using PYTHONPATH=/Users to set the environment variable.
